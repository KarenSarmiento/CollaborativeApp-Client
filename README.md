# Collaboration App

This repo contains the code for my dissertation project, whereby I implement the security and messaging infrastructure to support collaboration applications. It aims to demonstrate how conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) may be used to reassign the responsibility of merging peer updates from the server to the client, and therefore, how end-to-end encryption may be used.

An implementation of CRDTs is taken from the [Automerge library](https://github.com/automerge/automerge).
